# Simple Decision Tree Implementation (Java)

A lightweight implementation of a **Decision Tree** built entirely from scratch in Java to learn basic machine learning principles.  
This project demonstrates the core principles behind tree-based machine learning algorithms such as **ID3**, using a simple dataset which can be altered.

## Overview

This project provides an educational look into how a decision tree learns to split data based on information gain and how it can make predictions for new samples.

Key components:
- **Node Class** – Represents each node in the tree (feature, threshold, children, or leaf value).
- **DecisionTree Class** – Handles the training (`fit`) and prediction (`predict`) logic.
- **Main Class** – Provides a simple demonstration using example data.

## Features

- Builds a decision tree **without external ML libraries**  
- Uses **information gain** to find the best splits  
- Easily integratable into more advanced models like **Random Forests**
